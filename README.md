IT416 Computer Vision Class Project.

Vehicle Detection and Counting Interface for Traffic Analytics : 

We read that Mobilenet is a light-weight DNN architecture designed for mobiles and embedded vision applications. In many real-world applications such as a self-driving car, the recognition tasks need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computationally limited device.
But accuracy that we got for this project is 66% mAP. It is really hard to get a better accuracy using model that was built for mobile phones.
